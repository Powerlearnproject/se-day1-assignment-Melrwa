Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing, designing, testing and maintaining software by applying systematic engineering principals

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages e.g-Fortran and C
The establishment of the software engineering discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system documentation
Design-Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- this involves writing the code according to the specification of the user interface design 
Deployment- when software is released to users or customers 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- is the sequential approach with distinct phases, each phase at a particular time, flowing down like a waterfall
Agile-it is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change
Scrum- is an agile framework emphasising small, self-organising teams working in short iterations called sprints.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- they are responsible for writing code and implementing software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) gives software engineers ability to write, debug, and testing code e.g Visual Studio, Eclipse, IDEA and INTElliJ
Version Control Systems(VCS)- it aids the software engineer  track changes to source code and coordinate with other workers. e.g. Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements- to tackle the problem of changing requirements it is ideal to prioritize tasks before commencing development and regularly re-assess project goals.
Tight deadlines- by using Agile framework e.g scrum alongside effective communication it is easy to accomplish projects before the deadline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- is testing of individual components or module of a software
System testing- Testing of entire software as a whole.
Integration testing- is testing of the interaction of different components or subsystem
Acceptance testing- testing software against user 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering helps making our questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly wh

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-Describe United States of America 
Improved- Describe USA, listing each State, their corresponding capital and what they are known for, the age you can start driving per state and their corresponding governors 
Improved prompt enables user to get clear concise correct and complete response
